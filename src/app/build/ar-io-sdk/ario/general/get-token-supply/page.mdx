# getTokenSupply

`getTokenSupply` is a method on the `ARIO` class that retrieves the total supply of tokens, returned in mARIO. The total supply includes the following:

- `total` - the total supply of all tokens
- `circulating` - the total supply minus locked, withdrawn, delegated, and staked
- `locked` - tokens that are locked in the protocol (a.k.a. vaulted)
- `withdrawn` - tokens that have been withdrawn from the protocol by operators and delegators
- `delegated` - tokens that have been delegated to gateways
- `protocolBalance` - tokens that are held in the protocol's treasury. This is included in the circulating supply.

`getTokenSupply` does not require authentication.
