# Delegated Staking

## Overview

Delegated staking is a process by which a person can stake their own ARIO tokens on someone elses AR.IO gateway. The additional staked tokens increase that gateway's chance to be selected as an observer, and so they have the potential to earn more rewards.
In exchange, the person who delegates the tokens will receive a share of the gateway's rewards. Gateway operators can set the percentage of rewards are available for delegating wallets.

You can find more specific information about delegated staking and how rewards are distributed in the [AR.IO whitepaper](https://whitepaper_ar-io.arweave.dev/). 

You can easily delegate stake to a gateway by using the Gateway Portal at [ar://gateways](https://gateways.arweave.net/#/staking)
