# Arweave Name System (ArNS)

## Overview

The Arweave Name System (ArNS) is a decentralized, censorship-resistant naming system on Arweave. It allows data on Arweave to be assigned to friendly domain names. Learn more about ArNS [here](../../arns.md).

This guide will walk you through the process of purchasing and managing an ArNS name using [arns.app](https://arns.app), the official ArNS portal from AR.IO.
