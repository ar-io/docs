# ArNS Viewer

## Overview

This project explains how to use the ar.io sdk to query and interact with ArNS names in a web environment. It uses the new framework [ARNext](), which is a modification of NextJS that allows seamless deployments to arweave using an ArNS name, an Arweave transaction Id, or a traditional deployment to a service like Vercel without needing significant modifications to the project code, as was needed in the past.
