The goal of decentralised apps (dapps) has always been full stack. However, until now, that has not been possible due to single points of failure for hosting frontends.

Ar.io solves this via:

- **Permanent Storage**: Pay once and store your site forever on [Arweave](https://arweave.org/).
- **Smart Domains**: a sovereign owned domain-space via [Arweave Name System (ArNS)](/learn/arns).
- **Distributed Gateway Network**: access your site as a subdomain of ~600 active [gateways](/learn/gateways)

For example, this docs portal is a decentralised app:

- [docs.ar.io](https://docs.ar.io)
- [docs.arweave.net](https://docs.arweave.net)

Same app, different gateway.

You can repeat this by loading the `docs` subdomain for any of the ~600 active gateways in the network.

## What You'll Learn

In this guide series, you'll learn how to deploy and manage permanent applications on ar.io.

We'll cover the following:
