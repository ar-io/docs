The **Arweave Name System (ArNS)** provides human-readable names for Arweave content, making it easy to access and manage your permanent websites and applications. Learn how to register, manage, and use ArNS names effectively.

## What is ArNS?

ArNS is a decentralized naming system that allows you to:

- **Register human-readable names** like `myapp` instead of using long transaction IDs
- **Point names to content** stored on Arweave for permanent access
- **Create subdomains** (undernames) for organizing different versions and components
- **Establish web3 identity** with primary names linked to wallet addresses
- **Transfer ownership** of names through the ANT (Arweave Name Token) system

## Key Concepts

### ArNS Names

Human-readable identifiers that point to Arweave content, making it easy to access your permanent websites and applications.

### Undernames

Subdomains under your main ArNS name that allow you to organize different versions, components, and content types.

### Primary Names

ArNS names used as web3 identity that resolve to wallet addresses, enabling human-readable usernames across applications.

### ANT (Arweave Name Token)

The smart contract system that manages ArNS name ownership, transfers, and record updates.

## Common Use Cases

- **Permanent websites** - Host decentralized websites with memorable names
- **Application versioning** - Maintain multiple versions of your app using undernames
- **Web3 identity** - Use primary names as your identity across the ecosystem
- **Content organization** - Structure different types of content using undernames
- **API endpoints** - Create dedicated subdomains for different services
