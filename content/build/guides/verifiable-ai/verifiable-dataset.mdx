## Input Verification for AI Systems

Learn how to create verifiable datasets that prove the integrity of training data, whether stored on S3 or directly on Arweave.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **TypeScript** knowledge
- **Arweave Wallet (JWK file)** - We recommend [Wander](https://www.wander.app/)
- **Turbo Credits** - Purchase credits to pay for uploads. See [Turbo Credits guide](/build/upload/turbo-credits)

## Overview

This guide covers:

- Creating cryptographic proofs for datasets
- Uploading dataset manifests to Arweave
- Verifying dataset integrity
- Integrating with existing S3 workflows
