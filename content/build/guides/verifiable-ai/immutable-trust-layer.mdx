## Output and Liability Verification for AI Systems

Learn how to implement a Lambda Architecture for AI logging that streams encrypted evidence and builds analytics indices for complete algorithmic accountability.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **TypeScript** knowledge
- **Arweave Wallet (JWK file)** - We recommend [Wander](https://www.wander.app/)
- **Turbo Credits** - Purchase credits to pay for uploads. See [Turbo Credits guide](/build/upload/turbo-credits)
- Completed [The Verifiable Dataset](/build/guides/verifiable-ai/verifiable-dataset) guide
- Completed [The Signed Model Registry](/build/guides/verifiable-ai/signed-model-registry) guide

## Overview

This guide covers:

- Implementing the Speed Layer for real-time evidence streaming
- Building the Batch Layer with Parquet indices for analytics
- Creating tamper-proof audit trails
- Encrypting sensitive AI outputs
- Querying historical AI decisions
- Establishing algorithmic liability frameworks

## Summary

By completing this guide series, you've built a complete verifiable AI infrastructure with:

- **Verifiable Datasets** ensuring input integrity
- **Signed Model Registry** preventing process drift
- **Immutable Trust Layer** providing output accountability

Your AI systems now have cryptographic proof of their decisions, creating a foundation for enterprise trust and regulatory compliance.
