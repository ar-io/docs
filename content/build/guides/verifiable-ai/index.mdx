## From Black Box to Glass Box: The Verifiable AI Stack

The challenge with Enterprise AI is not just performance, but **provenance**. Standard cloud storage is mutable, making it difficult to prove exactly which dataset trained a model or what precise state an AI agent was in during a specific incident.

To solve **Algorithmic Liability**, AI systems require an immutable root of trust.

AR.IO Network facilitates this by enabling a **"Glass Box"** architecture:

- **Verifiable Datasets**: Prove the integrity of training data, whether it lives on S3 or directly on Arweave.
- **Signed Model Registries**: Prevent model drift by verifying weights against on-chain proofs before inference starts.
- **The Trust Layer**: A "Lambda Architecture" for logging that streams encrypted evidence for liability (Speed Layer) and builds Parquet indices for analytics (Batch Layer).

## What You'll Learn

In this guide series, you will build a production-grade **Verifiable AI Stack** using TypeScript and the Turbo SDK.
