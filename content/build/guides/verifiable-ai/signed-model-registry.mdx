## Process Verification for AI Models

Learn how to build a signed model registry that prevents model drift by verifying weights against on-chain proofs before inference starts.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **TypeScript** knowledge
- **Arweave Wallet (JWK file)** - We recommend [Wander](https://www.wander.app/)
- **Turbo Credits** - Purchase credits to pay for uploads. See [Turbo Credits guide](/build/upload/turbo-credits)
- Completed [The Verifiable Dataset](/build/guides/verifiable-ai/verifiable-dataset) guide

## Overview

This guide covers:

- Creating cryptographic signatures for model weights
- Storing model metadata on Arweave
- Verifying model integrity before inference
- Implementing a model registry service
- Preventing model drift and tampering
