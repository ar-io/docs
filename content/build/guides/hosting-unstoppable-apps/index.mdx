## Introduction

Unstoppable apps are **permanent, censorship-resistant applications** deployed to Arweave's permanent storage network and made accessible on decentralised domains, all powered by AR.IO Network.

To make this possible, AR.IO Network provides:

- **Fast reliable uploads**: [Turbo](/sdks/turbo-sdk) provide's fast Arweave uploads, flexible payments and immediate availability.
- **Smart Domains**: [Arweave Name System (ArNS)](/learn/arns) provide's a sovereign owned domain-space.
- **Distrubuted Gateway Network**: access your site as a subdomain of ~600 active [gateways](/learn/gateways)

For example, this docs portal is an unstoppable app:

- [docs.ar.io](https://docs.ar.io)
- [docs.arweave.net](https://docs.arweave.net)

Same app, different gateway.

This has always been the goal of full stack decentralised apps (dapps) but until now that has not been possible due to single points of failure for hosting frontends. 

In this guide series we'll demonstrate how to use the [permaweb-deploy](https://github.com/permaweb/permaweb-deploy) CLI tool to create an unstoppable deployment for any static site or App.

Let's get started.
