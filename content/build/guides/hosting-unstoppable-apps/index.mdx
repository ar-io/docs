## Introduction

Unstoppable apps are **permanent, censorship-resistant applications** deployed to Arweave's permanent storage network and made accessible through ArNS (Arweave Name System) domains. Unlike traditional web hosting that requires ongoing server maintenance and can be taken down, unstoppable apps are:

- **Permanent** - Your application lives forever on Arweave
- **Censorship-resistant** - No single entity can remove or modify your content
- **Decentralized** - No central servers or hosting companies required
- **Cost-effective** - Pay once to store your application forever
- **Human-readable** - Access your app via friendly ArNS names like `myapp.arweave.net`

This has always been the goal of full stack decentralised apps (dapps) but until now that has not been possible due to single points of failure for hosting frontends. AR.IO Network and Arweave Name System (ArNS) has solved this problem.

## How AR.IO Network Makes Apps Unstoppable

ArNS domains resolve across the entire AR.IO Network of 100+ independent gateways. This means your app at `myapp.arweave.net` is simultaneously accessible from:

- `myapp.arweave.net`
- `myapp.ar.io`
- ...and 100+ more gateway domains

Exactly the same app, different gateway.

This creates true redundancy - if one gateway is blocked or goes down, your app remains accessible through hundreds of others. No single point of failure exists.

In this guide series, you will learn how to deploy static websites, blogs, and EVM dApps to create truly unstoppable applications.
