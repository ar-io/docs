## Introduction

Deploying a blog to Arweave creates a **permanent, censorship-resistant website** accessible forever. Unlike traditional hosting where your content can disappear if you stop paying or if the host shuts down, content on Arweave is stored permanently for a one-time fee.

Your blog will be accessible as a subdomain of any of AR.IO Network's 600+ independent gateways, creating true redundancy with no single point of failure.

</Callout>

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher) and **npm** installed
- An **Arweave wallet** with storage credits
  - [Create a wallet](https://www.wander.app/) with Wander if you don't have one
  - [Top up storage credits](https://turbo.ar.io/topup) for uploading your site to Arweave
- [Purchase an ArNS name](/build/guides/working-with-arns/purchase-arns-ui) for human-readable URLs

## Project Setup

We'll use Vercel's official Next.js blog-starter template, which comes pre-configured with everything needed for a production-ready blog.

If you want to get moving quickly please [clone the example repo](https://github.com/kempsterrrr/next-blog-starter-arns).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create project from template">
    ```bash
    npx create-next-app@latest my-blog --example blog-starter
    cd my-blog
    ```

    This creates a new blog with:
    - Next.js 15 with App Router
    - TypeScript configuration
    - Tailwind CSS with dark mode support
    - Markdown processing (gray-matter + remark)
    - Three sample blog posts
    - Responsive design and SEO basics
  </Step>

  <Step title="Explore the project structure">
    ```
    my-blog/
    ├── _posts/              # Markdown blog posts
    │   ├── dynamic-routing.md
    │   ├── hello-world.md
    │   └── preview-mode.md
    ├── public/              # Static assets (images, favicons)
    ├── src/
    │   ├── app/             # Next.js pages and layouts
    │   ├── interfaces/      # TypeScript types
    │   └── lib/             # Utility functions
    └── package.json
    ```

    To add new blog posts, simply create `.md` files in the `_posts/` directory with frontmatter:

    ```markdown title="_posts/my-post.md"
    ---
    title: "My Permanent Blog Post"
    excerpt: "This post will live forever on Arweave"
    coverImage: "/assets/blog/my-image.jpg"
    date: "2024-01-15T00:00:00.000Z"
    author:
      name: "Your Name"
      picture: "/assets/blog/authors/avatar.jpg"
    ---

    Your markdown content here...
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test locally">
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see your blog with the sample posts.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build for production">
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    This creates a `.next/` directory. However, we need to configure static export for Arweave deployment (covered in the next section).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configure for Static Export

The blog-starter template uses Next.js's default build mode. To deploy to Arweave, we need to enable static export.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create next.config.js">
    Create a `next.config.js` file in your project root:

    ```javascript title="next.config.js"
    /** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
    const nextConfig = {
      output: 'export',
      images: {
        unoptimized: true,
      },
      trailingSlash: true,
    }

    module.exports = nextConfig
    ```

    **What this does:**
    - `output: 'export'` - Generates static HTML files instead of a Node.js server
    - `images.unoptimized: true` - Disables Next.js image optimization (not compatible with static hosting)
    - `trailingSlash: true` - Adds trailing slashes to URLs for better compatibility with static hosting
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build static site">
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    This now creates an `out/` directory containing your static blog ready for Arweave deployment.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test static build locally">
    You can test the static build using any static file server:

    ```bash
    npx serve out
    ```

    Visit the provided URL to verify everything works correctly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Deploy to Arweave with permaweb-deploy

Now that your blog is built, let's deploy it to Arweave using the `permaweb-deploy` CLI tool.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install permaweb-deploy">
    Install as a dev dependency in your project:

    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev permaweb-deploy
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add deployment scripts to package.json">
    Update your `package.json` to include deployment scripts:

    ```json title="package.json"
    {
      "scripts": {
        "dev": "next dev --turbopack",
        "build": "next build",
        "deploy": "npm run build && permaweb-deploy --deploy-folder out --arns-name myblog --ttl 60",
      }
    }
    ```

    **What these scripts do:**
    - `--deploy-folder` - Sets the folder to deploy to `out`
    - `--arns-name` - Sets the ArNS name to update
    - `--ttl 60` - Sets Time-To-Live to 60 seconds for fast gateway updates

    <Callout type="info">
    Replace `myblog` with your actual ArNS name in both scripts.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Prepare your wallet">
    From [Wander](https://www.wander.app/), export your wallet keyfile (JSON file).

    Encode it to base64

    ```bash
    base64 -i wallet.json | pbcopy
    ```

    <Callout type="warn" title="Security Warning">
    Never commit your wallet keyfile or DEPLOY_KEY to git! Keep wallet files outside your project directory and add them to `.gitignore`. For production use, we strongly recommend using **GitHub Actions with encrypted secrets** instead of local environment variables. This approach is more secure and eliminates the risk of accidentally exposing your wallet. **See the GitHub Actions section below**.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy your blog">
    Run the deployment:

    ```bash
    DEPLOY_KEY=$(base64 -i wallet.json) npm run deploy
    ```

    The command will:
    - Make your `DEPLOY_KEY` available in node
    - Upload all static build files file to Arweave
    - Create an Arweave manifest for these files and upload it
    - Update your ArNS record to resolve to the manifest's TxID

    ```bash
    Deployed TxId: abc123...

    Manifest TxId: xyz789...
    Updated ANT record for @ to xyz789...

    View at: https://myblog.arweave.net
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify deployment">
    Visit your ArNS URL (e.g., `https://myblog.arweave.net`) to see your live blog!

    <Callout type="info">
    It may take 5-30 minutes for the content to be fully accessible as it propagates across the AR.IO Network's gateways.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Automate Deployments with GitHub Actions

For continuous deployment on every push to your repository. **This is the recommended approach for production deployments** as GitHub encrypts your secrets and never exposes them in logs.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add wallet to GitHub Secrets">

    1. Encode your wallet to base64:
       ```bash
       base64 -i wallet.json | pbcopy
       ```

    2. Go to your repository on GitHub
    3. Navigate to **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**
    4. Click **New repository secret**
    5. Name: `DEPLOY_KEY`
    6. Value: Paste the base64-encoded wallet (from step 1)
    7. Click **Add secret**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create workflow file">
    Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

    ```yaml title=".github/workflows/deploy.yml"
    name: Deploy to Arweave

    on:
      push:
        branches: [main]
      workflow_dispatch:

    jobs:
      deploy:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
          - name: Checkout code
            uses: actions/checkout@v4

          - name: Setup Node.js
            uses: actions/setup-node@v4
            with:
              node-version: '18'
              cache: 'npm'

          - name: Install dependencies
            run: npm ci

          - name: Deploy to Arweave
            env:
              DEPLOY_KEY: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_KEY }}
            run: npm run deploy
    ```

    **Note:** Replace `myblog` in your package.json scripts with your actual ArNS name before committing.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Commit and push">
    ```bash
    git add .github/workflows/deploy.yml
    git commit -m "Add automated deployment to Arweave"
    git push origin main
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor deployment">
    - Go to your repository's **Actions** tab
    - Watch the deployment workflow run
    - See the deployment logs in real-time
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
The workflow runs on every push to `main`. You can also trigger it manually from the Actions tab using `workflow_dispatch`.
</Callout>
