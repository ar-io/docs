---

## Overview

A [Turbo ANS-104](https://github.com/ardriveapp/turbo-upload-service/) data item bundler can be run alongside an ar.io gateway. This allows gateways the ability to accept data items to be submitted to the Arweave blockweave.

The bundler service can be easily run inside Docker in the same way that the gateway is. It utilizes a separate docker compose file for configuration and deployment, which also allows for the use of a separate file for environmental variables specific to the bundler service. Additionally, the separation allows operators to spin their bundler service up or down at any time without affecting their core gateway service. Despite the use of separate docker compose files, the bundler service shares a docker network with the ar.io gateway, and so is able to directly interact with the gateway service and data.

For more information on ANS-104 Bundles, see the [ANS-104 Bundles](/learn/ans-104-bundles) page.

## Getting Started

<Callout type="warning">
  **NOTE**: The bundler service relies on GraphQL indexing of recently bundled
  and uploaded data to manage its pipeline operations. The ar.io gateway should
  have its indexes synced up to Arweave's current block height before starting
  the bundler's service stack.
</Callout>

<Steps>
<Step>
### Configure Environmental Variables

Environmental variables must be provided for the bundler to function and integrate properly with an existing ar.io gateway. The gateway repository provides a `.env.bundler.example` file that can be renamed to `.env.bundler` and used as a starting point. It contains the following:

```bash
BUNDLER_ARWEAVE_WALLET='Stringified JWK wallet. e.g: '{ "n": "...", ... }'
BUNDLER_ARWEAVE_ADDRESS='Address for above wallet'

APP_NAME='ar.io bundler service'

# Use localstack s3 bucket for shared data source between ar.io gateway and bundler
AWS_S3_BUCKET=ar.io
AWS_S3_PREFIX='data'
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='test'
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='test'
AWS_REGION='us-east-1'
AWS_ENDPOINT='http://localstack:4566'
```

- `BUNDLER_ARWEAVE_WALLET` must be the entire jwk of an Arweave wallet's keyfile, stringified. All uploads of bundled data items to Arweave will be signed and paid for by this wallet, so it must maintain a balance of AR tokens sufficient to handle the uploads.
- `BUNDLER_ARWEAVE_ADDRESS` must be the [normalized public address](/glossary) for the provided Arweave wallet.
- `APP_NAME` is a GraphQL tag that will be added to uploaded bundles.

The remaining lines in the `.env.bundler.example` file control settings that allow the bundler service to share data with the ar.io gateway. Data sharing of contiguous data between a bundler and a gateway allows the gateway to serve optimistically cached data without waiting for it to fully settle on chain.

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure Optimistic Indexing

</Step>

By default, the bundler will only accept data items uploaded by data item signers whose [normalized wallet addresses](/glossary) are in the `ALLOW_LISTED_ADDRESSES` list. This is an additional environmental variable that can be added to your `.env.bundler` file, and must be a comma separated list of normalized public wallet addresses for wallets that should be allowed to bundle and upload data through your gateway.

```bash
ALLOW_LISTED_ADDRESSES=<address1>,<address2>
```

The following permissioning configurations schemes are also possible:

| Scheme                     | ALLOW_LISTED_ADDRESSES                      | SKIP_BALANCE_CHECKS | ALLOW_LISTED_SIGNATURE_TYPES | PAYMENT_SERVICE_BASE_URL |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Allow Specific Wallets** | Comma-separated normalized wallet addresses | false               | EMPTY or supplied            | EMPTY                    |
| **Allow Specific chains**  | EMPTY or supplied                           | false               | arbundles sigtype int        | EMPTY                    |
| **Allow All**              | n/a                                         | true                | n/a                          | n/a                      |
| **Allow None**             | EMPTY                                       | false               | EMPTY                        | EMPTY                    |
| **Allow Payers**           | EMPTY or supplied                           | false               | EMPTY or supplied            | Your payment service url |

<Step>
### Set Up Indexing

Bundlers submit data to the Arweave network as an [ANS-104 data item bundle](https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave-standards/blob/master/ans/ANS-104.md). This means it is several transactions wrapped into one. A gateway will need to unbundle these transactions in order to index them. A gateway should include the following ANS-104 filters in order to unbundle and index transactions from a particular bundler:

```bash
ANS104_INDEX_FILTER={ "always": true }
ANS104_UNBUNDLE_FILTER={ "attributes": { "owner_address": "$BUNDLER_ARWEAVE_ADDRESS" } }
```

`$BUNDLER_ARWEAVE_ADDRESS` should be replaced with the [normalized public wallet address](/glossary) associated with the bundler.

**NOTE**: The above filters must be placed in the `.env` file for the core gateway service, not the bundler.

Gateways handle data item indexing asynchronously. This means they establish a queue of items to index, and work on processing the queue in the background while the gateway continues with its normal operations. If a gateway has broad indexing filters, there can be some latency in indexing data items from the bundler while the gateway works through its queue.

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure Optimistic Indexing

Gateway operators control access to their [optimistic data item indexing](/glossary) API via an admin key that must be supplied by all bundling clients in order for their requests to be accepted. This key should be made available in the environment configuration files for BOTH the core gateway, and the bundler, and should be provided as `AR_IO_ADMIN_KEY`:

```bash
AR_IO_ADMIN_KEY="Admin password"
```

**NOTE**: If a gateway is started without providing the admin key, a random string will be generated to protect the gateway's admin endpoints. This can be reset by restarting the gateway with the admin key provided in the `.env` file.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Starting and Stopping the Bundler

### Starting

The bundler service is designed to run in conjunction with an ar.io gateway, and so relies on the `ar-io-network` network created in Docker when the core gateway services are spun up. It is possible to spin up the bundler while the core services are down, but the network must exist in Docker.

To start the bundler, specify the env and docker-compose files being used in a `docker compose up` command:

```bash
docker compose --env-file ./.env.bundler --file docker-compose.bundler.yaml up -d
```

The `-d` flag runs the command in "detached" mode, so it will run in the background without requiring the terminal to remain active.

### Stopping

To spin the bundler service down, specify the docker-compose file in a `docker compose down` command:

```bash
docker compose --file docker-compose.bundler.yaml down
```

### Logs

While the bundler service is running in detached mode, logs can be checked by specifying the docker-compose file in a `docker compose logs` command:

```bash
docker compose --file docker-compose.bundler.yaml logs -f --tail=0
```

- `-f` runs the command in "follow" mode, so the terminal will continue to watch and display new logs.
- `--tail=` defines the number of logs to display that existed prior to running the command. `0` displays only new logs.

## Useful Docker Commands

Monitor and manage your bundler service with these commands:

```bash
# View all running services
docker ps

# Start bundler service in background
docker compose --env-file ./.env.bundler --file docker-compose.bundler.yaml up -d

# Stop bundler service
docker compose --file docker-compose.bundler.yaml down

# Pull latest bundler images
docker compose --file docker-compose.bundler.yaml pull

# Follow bundler logs
docker compose --file docker-compose.bundler.yaml logs -f --tail=10

# Check bundler service status
docker compose --file docker-compose.bundler.yaml ps

# Restart bundler service
docker compose --file docker-compose.bundler.yaml restart
```

## Next Steps
