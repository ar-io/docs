description: "Guide to configure Certbot with automatic SSL certificate renewal using NameCheap DNS API for AR.IO Gateway"
---

#### Note: Namecheap has specific requirements to create an API key. As of ~October 2024 they are:

- At least 20 domains under your account.
- A minimum of $50 in your account balance.
- At least $50 spent within the last 2 years.

If you do not meet these requirements, you can request a waiver by contacting Namecheap support.

#### Steps:

1. Navigate to Namecheap -> Profile > Tools > Manage API Access Keys

   (Go to your Namecheap account, click on your profile, then navigate to Tools > Manage API Access Keys to create your API credentials)


2. On your server, install certbot and DNS plugin for Namecheap

```bash
apt update
apt install certbot -y
```

3. Install pip

```bash
apt install python3-pip -y
```

4. Install DNS plugin for Namecheap

```bash
pip install certbot-dns-namecheap -y
```

5. Create ini file with api key and secret

```bash
nano /etc/letsencrypt/namecheap.ini
```

4. Add api key and secret created in step 1

```
dns_namecheap_username = <your_username>
dns_namecheap_api_key = <your_api_key>
```

5. Save the file and update permissions

```
chmod 600 /etc/letsencrypt/namecheap.ini
```

6. Generate certificate using certbot with DNS plugin for Namecheap

```bash
certbot certonly --dns-namecheap --dns-namecheap-credentials /etc/letsencrypt/namecheap.ini -d <domain.com> -d <\*.domain.com>
```

Results:

```bash
Successfully received certificate.
Certificate is saved at: /etc/letsencrypt/live/<domain.com>/fullchain.pem
Key is saved at: /etc/letsencrypt/live/<domain.com>/privkey.pem
```

7. Validate certificate and dns update with dry run (this will not create a new certificate or update dns)

```bash
certbot renew --dry-run
```

Results:

```bash

```

8. Reload nginx to apply new certificate (optional)

```bash
systemctl reload nginx
```

9. Validate certbot timer

```bash
systemctl list-timers | grep certbot
```

Results:

```bash

```
