# Decentralized AI

Artificial Intelligence thrives on vast amounts of data for training, analysis, and execution. Managing this data efficiently and securely gets harder when you need **immutability**, **auditability**, and **long-term accessibility**.

## How teams use this (examples)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Store training datasets & artifacts permanently">
    Keep the exact training inputs, configs, and outputs available for auditing and reproducibility.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Serve and retrieve data reliably">
    Use AR.IO gateways for performant access to historical and newly-published data—without tampering risk.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prove what was used (and when)">
    Leverage immutable provenance to satisfy governance, compliance, and trust requirements.
  </Step>
</Steps>
