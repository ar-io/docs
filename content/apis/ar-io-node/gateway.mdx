          Returns either gateway information or serves content based on
          configuration:


          - If neither APEX_TX_ID nor APEX_ARNS_NAME is set, returns gateway
          information

          - If APEX_TX_ID is set, serves that transaction's content

          - If APEX_ARNS_NAME is set, resolves and serves that ArNS name's
          content


          The Content-Type of the response will match the content type of the
          transaction or ArNS-resolved data (e.g., text/html for HTML documents,
          application/json for JSON documents, application/octet-stream for
          binary data, etc.).
      - content: Get the current health status of the ar.io Gateway.
