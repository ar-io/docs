          Stage a specific TX ID as priority for your Gateway to locate and
          index. This will trigger and queue bundle processing if the
          transaction is a bundle, and your Gateway is configured to unbundle
          and index.

          Queue one or more data items for indexing. This endpoint

          accepts an array of data item headers and prioritizes them for
          processing.
        heading: queue-data-items-for-indexing

          Returns detailed status information about a bundle's processing state,
          including counts of data items,

          processing timestamps, and retry attempts. This endpoint helps monitor
          the progress and state of bundle

          processing through the gateway's pipeline.

          Submits a TX ID/data-item ID or sha-256 content hash for content you
          do not want your Ar.io Gateway to serve. Once submitted, your Gateway
          will not respond to requests for these transactions or data-items.



          WARNING - Testing a TX ID here WILL result in that data being blocked
          by your Gateway.

          Initiates an export of data to Parquet format files. This process runs

          Removes stable data items from the database that were indexed before
          the specified timestamp.

          This helps manage database size by removing older, stable data items.
