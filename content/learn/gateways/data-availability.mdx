Data availability has two parts:

- **Permanent storage** from Arweave.
- **Reliable delivery** from gateways.

For production workloads, the key decision is not whether data exists, but how you want to deliver it with the guarantee level you need.

## Choose Your Access Strategy (Quick Recommendation)

| Strategy | Best for | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **A. Open network only** | Fast startup, prototypes, low-risk public content | Good default for early-stage projects |
| **B. Self-hosted gateway + network fallback** | Teams wanting control and custom policy | Strong production option when you can operate infra |
| **C. Managed gateway + network fallback** | Teams needing high availability with less ops overhead | **Recommended for production guarantees** |

<Callout type="tip">
  If uptime and performance guarantees matter, run a dedicated gateway path
  (self-hosted or managed) and keep the decentralized network as resilience and
  backup.
</Callout>

## What We Can Guarantee (Mode-Based)

### Network-level guarantees

With the ar.io gateway model, you get:

- **Retrievability through multiple paths**: requests can resolve through cache, trusted gateways, ar.io peers, chunk reconstruction, and tx-data fallback.
- **Open access across independent operators**: no single required public gateway.
- **Integrity/trust signals in responses**: headers such as `X-AR-IO-Verified`, `X-AR-IO-Trusted`, `X-AR-IO-Digest`, and `Content-Digest`.

### Network-level non-guarantees

At the public-network layer, there is no single global guarantee for:

- One universal latency target.
- One universal throughput target.
- One universal rate-limit profile across all operators.

### Dedicated gateway guarantees (managed or self-hosted)

When you run dedicated infrastructure (or have it managed for you), you can provide stronger guarantees, including:

- High-availability architecture and failover policy.
- Predictable performance targets for your workload profile.
- Explicit traffic policies and operational ownership.

In short: the network guarantees resilient access paths, while dedicated gateways are how you guarantee stricter production outcomes.

## Recommended Production Patterns

1. **Direct network access**: simplest path for non-critical or moderate workloads.
2. **Hybrid fallback**: dedicated primary gateway, network as backup.
3. **Managed HA primary + optional self-hosted secondary**: strongest balance of guarantees and independence.

## How Availability Works Under the Hood

Most gateways follow a layered read path:

1. Local cache.
2. Trusted gateways.
3. Ar.io network peers.
4. Chunk-based reconstruction.
5. Transaction-data fallback.

This layered path is why data stays reachable even when a single source is slow or unavailable.

## When to Use Wayfinder

Use [Wayfinder](/build/access/wayfinder) when you want client-side routing and failover across gateways without hard-coding a single endpoint.

Wayfinder is a strong default for production read paths that need resilience.
