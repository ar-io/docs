## Adding ARIO Token to Wander

Wander (formerly ArConnect) is the primary wallet for the Arweave ecosystem and provides native support for AO tokens like ARIO. Follow this guide to add ARIO to your wallet and start viewing your token balance.

## Prerequisites

Before adding ARIO to your Wander wallet, ensure you have:

- **Wander Wallet Installed**: Download from [wander.app](https://wander.app) for desktop or mobile
- **Wallet Setup Complete**: Your wallet should be created and secured with a backup phrase
- **Active Internet Connection**: Required for token import and balance queries

## Step-by-Step Workflow

    ### Access Settings Menu

    Navigate to the settings section of your wallet:

    **For Mobile Users:**
    1. Tap the **3 vertical dots** (⋮) in the top right corner of the screen
    2. Select **"Settings"** from the dropdown menu

  <Step>
    ### Configure Token Type (Desktop Only)

    **For Desktop Users:**
    - Ensure the **"Asset/Collectible"** dropdown is set to **"Asset"**
    - This tells Wander that you're adding a fungible token, not an NFT

       ```

       ```

    2. Once you enter the Process ID, Wander will automatically populate:
       - **Token Ticker**: "ARIO"
       - **Token Name**: "Ar.io Network"

    3. Verify that the auto-populated information is correct
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Complete the Import

    1. Click **"Add Token"** to complete the import process
    2. Wander will add ARIO to your token list and begin querying your balance
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Verify Token Addition

    After successful import, you should see:
    - ARIO listed in your wallet's token section
    - Your current ARIO balance (if you hold any tokens)

- **Actions**: Send, receive, and manage tokens

## Managing ARIO Tokens
