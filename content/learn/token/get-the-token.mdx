## Acquiring ARIO Tokens

ARIO exists on multiple networks:

- **AO ARIO (canonical):** The base asset that powers the AR.IO Network, staking, rewards, and ArNS.
- **Base ARIO (bridged):** A representation of AO ARIO on the Base L2 for EVM-based liquidity, tools, and integrations.

Choose between mainnet and testnet tokens based on your requirements.

  You can obtain ARIO on Base by swapping on a DEX or by bridging it from AO.

  ### Bridge

  Bridge from AO to Base (and vice versa) via the **[ARIO Bridge](https://swap.ar.io)**.

  ### Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)

  Acquire Base ARIO on Base-native DEXs:

  - **[Hydrex](https://www.hydrex.fi/swap?tokenIn=0x833589fcd6edb6e08f4c7c32d4f71b54bda02913&tokenOut=0x138746adfa52909e5920def027f5a8dc1c7effb6)**
  - **[Coinbase DEX](https://www.coinbase.com/dex)** (via Coinbase mobile app or Base integration)

  <Callout type="info">
  <strong>Important:</strong> Always verify the contract address before swapping. DEXs are permissionless, and imposters can appear.

  2. **Delegate Tokens:** Stake your ARIO with them to increase their total stake.  
  3. **Earn Rewards:** Share in their rewards proportionally to your delegation.  
  4. **Unstake Anytime:** Withdraw after the standard protocol delay period.
